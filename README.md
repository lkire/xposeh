# xposeh
Expos√© is a python tool for exposing model hyper-parameters to local or highly scalable tuning scenarios
in a natural way.
By decorating a python function, one registers it as a module, selectively exposing parameters
for automated visualization tools to capture and for hyper-parameter tuners to modify.


## Under development
Functionality will appear in the following order (roughly by date):
- local multiprocessing toolset (April 2019)
- dask (May 2019)
- gui integration (June 2019)
- spark (July 2019)
- docker swarm/kubernetes (AUgust 2019)
